<p><i><b>Give a Brief description of your show: names, dj names, how long have you been doing this, style, etc.</b></i><br>
My show, “Mama’s Midcoast Bluegrass” has been airing on WBOR for more than five years now. I started in radio doing news broadcasts from Sacred Heart U. in CT. While in the Navy, I was on Armed Forces Radio (AFRTS) and, also, did a country show behind the local cable TV information channel in Alaska for a few years.  As a 20 year member of local bluegrass band “Windy Ridge”, and charter member and current Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bluegrass Music Association Of Maine, I love to get this genre of music out to the “masses”. I play songs from my personal bluegrass collection which is continuously growing. Getting the word out about live performances, festivals and public-invited jams is an important part of my show.  As one of a handful of community DJs (many of whom have been steadily broadcasting for many years, decades even), I think I speak for most when I say that we embrace WBOR as an important part of our lives and have a special affection for the station and our commitment towards our individual shows.  And I know the community at large feels that WBOR is definitely a cherished voice here in Brunswick and beyond. BTW, I have a Facebook page dedicated to my show. Type “Mama’s Midcoast Bluegrass Radio Show” in the search box and ‘like’ me - (I crave external validation…)

<i><b>Greatest musician of all time and why?</b></i><br/>
This is a toughy…Of course the bluegrass genre would not be here without Bill Monroe, so he certainly comes to mind. But surprisingly I would have to agree with my dad, and go with Bing Crosby, who’s unfaltering vocal tone and body of work is unmatched IMNSHO.
<br/><br/>
<i><b>Song that makes you cry?</b></i><br>
The first time I heard Garth Brooks’ “The Dance”, it hit me where I lived.  And, no matter how hard I try, when I sing “Kilkelly, Ireland” I cannot seem to get through it without tearing up.
<br><br>
<i><b>Most amazing concert experience?</b></i><br>
If you have never been to a bluegrass festival, I don’t know if I can relate the degree of sensory overload that accompanies it.  All I know, is that between listening to some of the best bluegrass bands, spending a week/weekend elbow to elbow with thousands of bluegrass musicians and enthusiasts, playing ALL night and day with said musicians (where the amateurs can sometimes play as well or better than those onstage), I always have an amazing experience!
<br><br>
<i><b>Best song to drive to?</b></i><br>
Usually one that I am learning to play, currently it’s an Irish tune called “The Banks of the Sweet Viledee” by Dervish. (Irish is my other favorite genre). 
<br><br>
<i><b>If you were stuck on a desert island, what three albums would you take with you and why?</b></i><br>
Another tough one….hopefully I’ll never have to choose. But for sake of argument - The David Grisman Bluegrass Experience, the Boxcars CD called “All In” and, hmmm, Paul McKenna’s “Stem the Tide”. They are just easy and enjoyable to listen to.
<br><br>
<i><b>Best guilty pleasure and/or sing-a-long song and why?</b></i><br>
Easy, Billy Joel’s “Piano Man”, how can you not sing along with that one..
<br/><br/>
<i><b>If you could meet any musician, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</b></i><br>
One of my early influences included Harry Chapin. I’m not sure what I’d even ask him. I was lucky enough to see him in concert twice, and wouldn’t mind just having a chat about where the stories in his songs came from.
<br/><br/>
<i><b>Most played song on your iTunes?</b></i><br>
One of my all-time favorites is “Won't You Come And Sing For Me” by local musician/fiddler, Erica Brown.  It’s an old Hazel Dickens tune that Erica tears up.
<br><br>
<i><b>Favorite era of music?</b></i><br>
The current era in bluegrass is really awesome. There are new songs that are reminiscent of the old standards coming out alongside some newer progressive stuff.  It’s a good time to be a bluegrass fan.
<br><br>
<i><b>Favorite place in Maine?</b></i><br>
As a youngster, I spent a lot of time on East Moody Island on Moosehead Lake, across from Mount Kineo. It’d be hard to find a better place in Maine, or anywhere for that matter.
<br><br>
<i><b>Favorite vegetable?</b></i><br>
Broccoli, because it looks like a little tree?<br><br>
<i><b>When can we tune into your show?</b></i><br>
Currently from 12:30 to 2:30 pm EST on MONDAYS!!
