A module which should simplify use of radio station models.

Right now the idea is to use inheritance of database classes. This is probably
disgusting and I'm sure there are plenty of arguments on the internet against
this, even specifically within GAE. If shouldn't be too hard to change everything
to encapsulation instead (where each leaf child just has a variable dealing with
the model it interacts with instead of being said model).
