Here's what we have to do on this branch before it is ready for deployment
and being tested for "release" status.

    functional
    It ain't perfect, but it should do for now
  TODO: Add last edited/added DJs to manage DJs page to fix new errors
  TODO: Implement last edited Programs in manage Programs page
  TODO: Make Programs searchable so that manage Programs is functional
  TODO: Use new DJ search functionality in manage programs instead of AC

  TODO: Remove last remnants from old models (i.e. "models." calls) from main/dj

  cached
  Progress made
